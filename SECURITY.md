## Reporting a Vulnerability

For people liking automation, there is https://art.midnightthoughts.space/.well-known/security.txt available.

A security report should be written in English.
German also is fine for me but should be avoided.
Other languages will not be accepted, as I don't speak those.

A report should contain the affected version, what is affected, how it is affected and if you know a solution please share it with me, so I can react quickly.

Please also follow the responsible disclosure concept. I will try to react as fast as possible. However, please keep in mind this is a Hobby project, so I may not react within 48h.

To contact me, please use **ONLY** one of these options:

**Matrix:** matrix:u/mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev (Or https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev )

**Email:** mailto:mtrnord[AT]nordgedanken.dev

Please **DO NOT** under any circumstance do it via GitHub issues as this will leak the report to the public!

For any further issues, please open an Issue or join https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-art:nordgedanken.dev
